Analysing Kaggle's New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 dataset
Done by Ekaterina Kryukova

In this project I analysed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. The dataset provided by Kaggle  contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.
The goal of the project was to perform an analysis and to create visual tools to communicate the results.

I calculated summary statistics, drew an inference from the statistics, calculated business metrics and used models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. 

Excel Analysis

1.The Data Excel tab provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.
2. The Summary_statistics Excel tab includes the summary statistics measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measure of spread (standard deviation).
3 The Histogram Excel tab demonstrates Histograms to answer the question:  Does the consumer discretionary sector have similar total revenue levels than the consumer stamples sector in Year 4? The PDF „Project_Presentation“
interprets the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation)
4. The P&L Statement Dashboard tab represents a dynamic P&L dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement. It pulls historical fundamentals data to calculate the Gross Profit and EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. I used INDEX and MATCH Excel Functions to build the P&L Statement Dashboard.
The P&L statement includes the Gross Profit and EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
5. The Forecast Scenarios tab demonstrates a financial model for ABC company that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case). I used OFFSET and MATCH Excel functions to build the model. The assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin change for each scenario.
The forecasting model is dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong and static for the chosen company sticker symbol.
